# Demos with motor
Greetings. This is my repo where I put all the real-time audio/visual demos made with my engine.

This repo readme is building up. If you are interested, I stream regularly over at [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/aconstlink) and also on my [YT](https://www.youtube.com/@aconstlink) channel.


I try to document more here but at the moment, I am very busy getting the async shader compilation up and running. Unfortunately, that requires many changes. Just head over to the repo of my engine [motor](https://github.com/aconstlink/motor) and see whats going on...
